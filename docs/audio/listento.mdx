    ease= "Audiomovers Listento is a plug and play solution to online musicking, which requires simple routing concepts and a DAW that accepts VST, AU, and AAX plugins. The latency created by Listento can be very minimal and workable. The only setback of Listento is the requirement of bandwidth if higher bit depth formats are used, such as PCM audio, but the quality of the audio can be configured to optimize latency."
