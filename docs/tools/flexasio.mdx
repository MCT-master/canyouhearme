    ease= "FlexASIO is an audio driver for Windows that achieves far lower latency than the default audio drivers when using audio intensive applications (DAWs, real-time communication). We recommend it for any application where low-latency audio performance is essential. Thus, it is highly recommended to optimize latency when there is no external sound card available. Installing is straightforward, but further configuration is possible."
