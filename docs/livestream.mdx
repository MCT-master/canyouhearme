Covid-19 presented society with a host of challenges, and continuing to have concerts is one of them.",

                    "By the other hand, when it comes to LED lights, in most models you have much more control of the intensity and other features of the light. Even in the cheapest models, you can find temperature control, intensity (dimmering) and some of them come with a soft-box for diffusing the lights. The LED lights are also much lighter and portable, requiring cheaper stands and less effort to transport it and set it up."

On the other hand, they were very useful, especially because we had a dimmer to control the power of the lights. They were well used when the face and other details of the subject in the scene were a bit in the shadow."
